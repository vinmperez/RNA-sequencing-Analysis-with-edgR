# RNA-sequencing-Analysis-with-edgR
This is an R code to obtain differentially expressed genes from count files. There are 4 files in this repository.

1. The readme.txt for instructions.
2. The edgeR.R file, which is used to interpret the counts.csv file
3. The counts.csv file for the data
4. The final output of the PCA plot, also shown below.

The final output provides a PCA plot that clusters the samples by their transcriptome profiles such as this:
